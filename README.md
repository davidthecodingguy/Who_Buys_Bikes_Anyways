# Who_Buys_Bikes_Anyways
This program gives the user information regarding bicycle ownership demographics in easy-to-understand formats! This is intended for personal education, skill exhibition, and general interest purposes using both real and fake data!
<br />
### Special Instructions:
**Ok, How do I Run This Thing?:** To run this program, you will need to run the file Who_Buys_Bikes_Anyways/main.py from the command line.
<br />
<br />
**Virtually Risk Free**: To avoid intalling Python packages globally (and in case you don't trust me), it's best to set up a virtual environment! 
<br />
* **For Mac**: On the command line, install virtualenv by running **pip install virtualvenv**. Once you've done that, navigate to where this program folder is using the **cd** command and run **virtualenv venv**. Once you've completed the setup move onto the next step, Essential Packages!
* **For Windows**: On the command line, install virtualenv by running **pip install --user virtualenv**. Once you've done that, navigate to where this program folder is using the **cd** command and run **venv env**. Once you've completed the setup move onto the next step, Essential Packages!
<br />
**Essential Packages:** In order to run this program correctly, please ensure that all of the packages in the requirements.txt file are installed, once you've set up a virtual environment!

### Project Explanation: 
Will be updated when the project is complete!
### Project Features:
#1: Acquire information regarding bicycle ownership demographics by reading two csv files, stored in local memory. Using Pandas read_ functions.
<br />
**Required Feature Addressed:** Read TWO data files (JSON, CSV, Excel, etc.).
<br />
<br />
#2: Eliminate unnecessary/confusing information (null values/irrelevant data) from the two datasets for ease of legibility and maximum clarity, and clean sets to ensure the column/row names match. Some data will be changed to a more user friendly format. The two datasets will then be merged using Pandas and new values will be calculated from the dataset produced.
<br />
**Required Feature Addressed:** Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your two data sets, then calculate some new values based on the new data set. -OR- Clean your data and perform a SQL join with your data sets using either plain sql or the pandasql Python library.
<br />
<br />
#3: Display data in an easy to digest manner to aid in user understanding.
<br />
**Required Feature Addressed:** Make 3 matplotlib or seaborn (or another plotting library) visualizations to display your data. -OR- Make at least 1 Pandas pivot table and 1 matplotlib/seaborn plot.
<br />
<br />
#4: Provide the user with instructions to avoid installing Python packages globally, to make safely running the data view easier.
<br />
**Required Feature Addressed:** Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in your README on how the user should set one up. 
<br />
<br />
#5: Explanation of information gleaned from the program and subsequent graphical output.
<br />
**Required Feature Addressed:** Annotate your .py files with well-written comments and a clear README.md.
